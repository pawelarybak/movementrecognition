# Movement Recognition

A project for computer vision class.

Each script takes path to video as an argument.

Project consists of two scripts. Each one is a method for movement recognition.
First one (_movementRecognition.py_) uses [MOG2 background subtractor](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_video/py_bg_subtraction/py_bg_subtraction.html#backgroundsubtractormog2) 
. Second one (_opticalFlow.py_) uses [OpticalFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow).
